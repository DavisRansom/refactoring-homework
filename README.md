<Refactoring-Homework>
I completed this project with my class at the UCSD Full-Stack Bootcamp.

The author of this project is Davis Ransom.

What was your motivation?
My motivation for this assignment was to learn functional CSS and HTML and develop a workflow that I could use consistently in the future.

Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to deepen my understand of web accessibility and how to deal with issues surrounding that topic.

What problem does it solve?
The problem that the page solves is providing consumers information about Horiseon Business Services.

What did you learn?
I learned so much! I learned about html tags, ids, and classes. I also learned how to link my CSS folder to the index.html file, and how to clear away redundant code, as well as how to use HTML tags to make a website easier to understand for others who look at it. Also, I learned about the life of a coder, because I got so frustrated so many times, especially when I was so close to finishing the entire project, then I broke it somehow (I accidentally deleted my CSS file), and had to start from the beginning.

What makes your project stand out?
My project is clean and thorough. It may not stand out, but this was my first real experience with any type of computer programming, so the project will definitely stand out to me!

Special thanks to Dillan Mansor for his help and patience!
